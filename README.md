# Challenge-04-Time-Code-Quiz

This project is to create timed code quiz, with a high score system set to user's local storage. When opening the site, user is prompted with an intro page with 'view high score' and a start button. When clicking on the 'view high score', user is directed to the high score page. When clicked on the start button, user begin the quiz with the first question and the timer is set to 75 seconds. When clicking on the right answer, user will be prompted with 'CORRECT!' if wrong the timer will be deducted by 10 seconds and prompted with 'INCORRECT!'; after clicking on the answer, user will be given the next question. 
When there are no remaining question or the timer is 0 seconds, then the user will be prompted with the result page. The page will provide the user's score and an input to save their score with their initials. Upon saving the score, the user will be moved to the highscore page and all score saved will be listed in order from highest score to the lowest.
